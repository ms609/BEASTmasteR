\title{Average the heights of (non-fossil) tips to make ultrametric-ish.}
\usage{
average_tr_tips(tr, fossils_older_than = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{tr}{An ape phylo object}

\item{fossils_older_than}{Tips that are older than \code{fossils_older_than} will be excluded from the tips that
are going to be averaged. This is not currently set to 0, because Newick files can have slight precision issues etc.
that mean not all tips quite come to zero (which is why you need \code{\link{average_tr_tips}} in the first place!).
Obviously you should be cautious about the value of , depending on the absolute timescale of your tree. Make sure you do
not inappropriately average in fossils!!}
}
\value{
\code{edge_times_bp} A 2-column matrix with the age (from the present) of the top and bottom of each edge.
}
\description{
When you have a digitized tree, or other slightly uneven source tree, average the tips
to get them all to line up at 0 my before present.  This makes an ultrametric tree
if and only if there are no fossil tips in the tree.
}
\details{
If the user includes fossils accidentally, this function can easily lead to pathological
results (negative branch lengths etc.), so use with care!!
